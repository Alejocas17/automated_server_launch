# ===============================================================================================
# 
# Animations are created from an Id
# An Animation contains a tick amount that defines how quickly the Animation is updated in ticks
# The content of the Animation defines which lines should be looped through
# 
# ColorCodes and PlaceholderAPI Placeholders can be used in an Animation
# 
# Animations can contain other Animations, but only those created before the containing Animation
# In the example with "test" and "test2" -> only "test2" may contain "test" but "test" may not contain "test2"
# 
# Ingame you can insert an Animation in the format "%animation_id%" like "%test%"
#
